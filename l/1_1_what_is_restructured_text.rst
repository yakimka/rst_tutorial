=====================================
Lesson 1.1: What is reStructuredText?
=====================================

Welcome to the interactive reStructuredText tutorial!

reStructuredText (often abbreviated as RST, ReST, or reST) is a lightweight markup language.
It's designed to be easy to read in its plain text form and can be converted into various other
formats like HTML or PDF using tools like Docutils_.

Think of it as a way to write structured documents (like articles, documentation, or even books)
using simple text conventions that you can type in any basic text editor.

Key Characteristics:
--------------------

*   **Plain Text First**: The raw reStructuredText you write should be easily readable on its own.
*   **Simple Syntax**: It uses straightforward patterns for common formatting needs.
    For example, blank lines separate paragraphs, and asterisks are used for emphasis.
*   **Extensible**: For more complex needs, reStructuredText uses "directives" â€“ special
    commands that can create things like tables, images, or specially formatted blocks of text.
*   **Widely Used**: It's a popular choice for software documentation
    (including Python's own documentation), project README files, and any situation where
    you need to create well-structured documents from plain text.

The Goal of reStructuredText:
-----------------------------

The main idea behind reStructuredText is to offer a markup system that is:

1.  **Unobtrusive**: The markup symbols should blend in with the text as much as possible.
2.  **Intuitive**: The syntax should be easy to learn and remember.
3.  **Powerful**: Capable of representing complex document structures.

In this tutorial, we'll explore these features step by step.

**Your Task:**

Familiarize yourself with the example below. Try making small changes:

1. Add a new paragraph.
2. Try changing some text to be *emphasized* (italic) or **strongly emphasized** (bold).
3. Add a new line of ``inline literal text``.
   Observe how your changes are rendered in the HTML output panel.

# Lesson Example

This is a simple paragraph in reStructuredText.
It's written in plain text.

This is another paragraph.
Paragraphs are separated by one or more blank lines.

You can easily create *emphasized text* (usually shown as italics)
or **strongly emphasized text** (usually shown as bold).
For code snippets or to show text exactly as it is, you can use ``inline literal text``.
