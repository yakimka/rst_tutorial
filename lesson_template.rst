Lesson X.Y: Lesson Title
======================

.. IMPORTANT::
   This file serves as a template for creating new lessons.
   The content above the "# Lesson Example" separator will be displayed as the lesson description
   and instructions in the left panel of the application.
   The content below the "# Lesson Example" separator will be pre-loaded into the
   reStructuredText input area (middle-right panel) and rendered as HTML in the
   output area (bottom-right panel).

   When writing reStructuredText, please try to keep line lengths between 80 and 120 characters
   for better readability.

   For inline code or literal text, use double backticks: ``text_goes_here``

   * This is a bullet list.
     Lists must be separated from surrounding text by blank lines (above and below).
   * It has two items.

   1. This is a numbered list.
      It also needs blank lines around it.
   2. It also has two items.

   Replace "Lesson X: Lesson Title" with the actual lesson number and title.
   Fill in the description and task for the student below.
   Don't copy this block to the lesson.

(Provide a clear and concise explanation of the reStructuredText concept being taught in this lesson.
Include any necessary theory, syntax explanations, and examples directly within this description
section if they are part of the core lesson material the student needs to read and
understand *before* attempting the interactive example.)

**Your Task:**

(Clearly state what the student is expected to do.
If the '# Lesson Example' (right panel) is pre-filled, your task should guide the student to modify
the existing content and observe the changes. For example: "Modify the provided list to include a third item,"
or "Change the heading level and see how it affects the output."
If the task is to reproduce a piece of reStructuredText (e.g., an example shown rendered in this left panel),
then the '# Lesson Example' (right panel) should ideally be empty or contain minimal boilerplate,
and your task would be something like: "Recreate the document structure shown in the example above.")

(You can use any reStructuredText markup here to format the lesson content, such as lists,
bold/italic text, code blocks for syntax examples, etc.)

.. code-block:: rst

   Example of how to show syntax if needed in the description:

   * This is a bullet list
   * It has two items

   1. This is a numbered list
   2. It also has two items

Remember to be clear and guide the student effectively.

# Lesson Example

.. This is a comment in reStructuredText.
   The reStructuredText content below this line will be pre-loaded into the
   interactive editor for the student.
   - If 'Your Task' involves modifying existing content, provide a relevant starting point here.
     This could be a complete, working example, or an example with intentional mistakes
     for the student to fix, depending on the lesson's goal.
   - If 'Your Task' involves the student creating content from scratch (e.g., reproducing an
     example shown in the lesson description), this section might be left empty or contain
     only minimal boilerplate to guide the student.

   Don't copy this block to the lesson.

   Start your example for the student here.
   For instance, if the lesson is about headings, you might include:

My Example Document
===================

This is a paragraph under the main heading.

Subsection
----------

This is a paragraph under a subsection.
   You can also include more complex examples.
   Make sure this part is valid reStructuredText or intentionally contains
   elements the student needs to work with or correct.
