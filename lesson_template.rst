Lesson X.Y: Lesson Title
========================

.. IMPORTANT::
    This file is a template for generating new lessons.
    The content above the "# Lesson Example" separator will appear as the lesson
    description/instructions (left panel). The content below will preload into the
    reStructuredText editor (top-right) and render as HTML (bottom-right).

    - Do NOT include "# Lesson Example" in the description.
    - Keep lines between 80 and 120 characters.
    - Use 4 spaces for indentation.
    - Inline code or literals: use double backticks: ``text``.
    - Surround lists and blocks with blank lines.
    - Insert inline links to relevant sections of the official spec below, and
      list all URLs in the References block at the end of this description.

(Explain the reStructuredText concept clearly and concisely here. Include theory,
syntax notes, and inline examples as needed. Reference specific sections of the spec
using short anchors. Use anchors from `rst_docs/restructuredtext.rst`.)

**Your Task:**

(Describe exactly what the student should do in the interactive section. For modifying
existing content, guide them to change examples and observe effects. For creating
from scratch, provide minimal boilerplate.)

.. code-block:: rst

    .. Optional snippet showing syntax if needed for the task.

# Lesson Example

.. This section preloads for the student. Provide a starting point:

.. If the task is to fix markup, include an example with intentional issues.
.. If it's to build structure, leave only minimal boilerplate.
