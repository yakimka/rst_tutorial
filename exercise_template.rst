.. IMPORTANT::
   This file serves as a template for creating new lessons.
   The content above the "# -Example-" separator will be displayed as the lesson description
   and instructions in the left panel of the application.
   The content below the "# -Example-" separator will be pre-loaded into the
   reStructuredText input area (middle-right panel) and rendered as HTML in the
   output area (bottom-right panel).

   Replace "Lesson X: Lesson Title" with the actual lesson number and title.
   Fill in the description and task for the student below.

Lesson Description & Task
-------------------------

(Provide a clear and concise explanation of the reStructuredText concept being taught in this lesson.
Include any necessary theory, syntax explanations, and examples directly within this description
section if they are part of the core lesson material the student needs to read and
understand *before* attempting the interactive example.)

**Your Task:**

(Clearly state what the student is expected to do or achieve using the interactive reStructuredText editor.
For example: "Recreate the document structure shown below," or "Experiment with different list types,"
or "Fix the errors in the provided example to make it render correctly.")

(You can use any reStructuredText markup here to format the lesson content, such as lists,
bold/italic text, code blocks for syntax examples, etc.)

.. code-block:: rst

   Example of how to show syntax if needed in the description:
   * This is a bullet list
   * It has two items

   1. This is a numbered list
   2. It also has two items

Remember to be clear and guide the student effectively.

# -Example-

.. IMPORTANT::
   The reStructuredText content below this line will be pre-loaded into the
   interactive editor for the student. It should be a practical example related
   to the lesson, which the student can modify and learn from.
   It can be a complete, working example, or an example with intentional mistakes
   for the student to fix, depending on the lesson's goal.

.. This is a comment in reStructuredText.
   Start your example for the student here.
   For instance, if the lesson is about headings, you might include:

My Example Document
===================

This is a paragraph under the main heading.

Subsection
----------

This is a paragraph under a subsection.
   You can also include more complex examples.
   Make sure this part is valid reStructuredText or intentionally contains
   elements the student needs to work with or correct.
